			Since Sweet Corn Swingout is at the same time as Iowa City Jazz
			Festival, an event that takes over all of the downtown, we
				recommend planning an extra 15 minutes to navigate through
				downtown and find parking. All venues are in downtown Iowa City.
					<a
						href="https://www.icgov.org/government/departments-and-divisions/transportation/transit">All
						Iowa City buses</a> and the <a
						href="https://transportation.uiowa.edu/cambus">UI
					cambuses</a> are free and all our locations are walkable in
				downtown.
